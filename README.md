Self-deployable application that will help you monitor car listings on Kijiji.

If you are looking for multiple used or new models and would like to ease the work needed to search up multiple listings, this application will help you keep a single view of all of the ads you want to watch.

Enter the exact Kijiji urls (per page) and it will scrape the site at that url for the available listings and information. A link will be provided to you to navigate to the actual listing.

Currently only working locally. It can be adjusted to be hosted on the cloud but the resources required is unknown.
